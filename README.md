# Intermediate Perl - EDI 2016

Developer-led course covering the Intermediate Perl, 2nd Edition book from O'Reilly. This builds Perl skills and concepts to a higher level than covered by Learning Perl. Each section of the course involves reading a chapter of the book, completing exercises from that chapter, peer reviewing another learner's solutions, and discussing chapter contents with colleagues. It is expected that sections are completed on a weekly basis.
