# Christmas challenge

*Obsfucated* code is that which is written with the exact opposite of software engineering best-practices
in mind&mdash; the program should do everything in the most confusing and least readable way possible. With
its mass of control switches and obscure syntax forms, Perl is an ideal medium for this art.

While we're waiting for Intermediate Perl to resume on the 17th January, let's have a little fun. Create
merge requests into this folder with your obsfucated Perl attempts&mdash; we'll all then vote on our favourites.

## Rules

* It's a Christmas competition, so try to make entries Christmas or holiday themed.
* Original work please! There's loads of obsfucated Perl samples on the internet, but I'd be more interested to
see what people can come up with themselves.
* Programs don't have to do anything useful; it could just print out a single line.
* There's no official character limit, but shorter is always better!
* Use the classic folder format of `xmas/<username>/<program>`.
* You can enter multiple times if you like.
* To save voters' sanity, consider including sample input and/or output with your merge request.
* All entries to be in by Tuesday, 10th January.
* Voting to conclude by Sunday, 15th January.
